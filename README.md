### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Use MVVM in a Universal Windows App

#### Instructor: Vivek Maskara

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern helps developers separate an application's business and presentation logic from its user interface. Maintaining a clear separation between application logic and user interface helps address development and design issues, making an application easier to test, maintain, and develop. It can also improve the reusability of code and it allows multiple developers to collaborate more easily when working on the same project.
